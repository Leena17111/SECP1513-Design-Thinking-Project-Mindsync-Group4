## Reflections on the Design Thinking Project

This project was a valuable experience in understanding the **design thinking process**, from empathizing with users to testing the final prototype. It taught me the importance of:
- **Empathy:** Understanding user needs through interviews and surveys.
- **Team Collaboration:** Working effectively as a group to brainstorm, prototype, and refine ideas.
- **Iteration:** Improving solutions based on user feedback during the test phase.

I gained skills in **problem-solving**, **communication**, and **prototyping**, which are essential for real-world software development. I also plan to:
- Explore **new technologies** that enhance user-centered design.
- Continue practicing **team-based projects** to build stronger collaboration skills.
- Focus on integrating mental health and productivity tools in future software solutions.
